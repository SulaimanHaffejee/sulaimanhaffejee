Hi my name is Sulaiman Haffejee, I am a **Frontend Engineer and SEO specialist** with 5 years professional experience currently based in South Africa. 

I have a passion for seamless UX and clean crisp UI. I utilise **HTML,CSS,Javascript, Typescript, Angualr and Reactjs** to provide state of the art web applications for my clients.

 I as well build Content Management Systems such as **Wordpress, Craft CMS and OpenCart** which enable me to build informational and eCommerce sites with ease.

**SEO** has grown with me as its the next step once the site is completed.

If I am not developing anything on the web, I'm either gaming or developing games on the side, along with binging animes,TV Series and geek out on Marvel,Tolkien and Star Wars.
